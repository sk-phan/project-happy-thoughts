# Happy Thoughts

 Week 11 at Technigo and we are building a Happy Thought website which is similar to Facebook, Twitter and inspires users to share positive thoughts. 
 The goals are to build a simple API, and to master React hook (useState, useEffect). 
 In addition, I re-designed the UI based on Technigo's template in order to add more functionalities and make it more user friendly.

 
## The problem

 At the beginning, it was challenging for me to understand how to use 'useEffect' in React effectively. 
 After hours of Googling and learning from external learning platforms, I turned to be more confident to work React and started to implement the useEffect in different cases to get the best out of it.

Besides that, my goal was to build save posts which were liked by users to local storage and display them nicely on the site. The final solutions was to save the item to local storage every time the user click Like and update them directly in the initial useState.

 Few functionalities which I added to the app including:
    - Thought Inspiration for those who can't find a happy thought and inspire them to share
    - Background Setting for users to change background
    - Counter to count how many posts user have liked and display them
